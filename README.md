# ReinforcedTraffic: Traffic Optimization using Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Project Overview

This project explores the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion in simulated environments. The primary focus of this research is the implementation and evaluation of the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm.

## Key Features

*   **DQN Implementation**: A robust implementation of the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm tailored for traffic signal control or other traffic management tasks.
*   **Simulation Environment**: (Describe your simulation environment briefly, e.g., SUMO, a custom grid, etc.)
*   **Performance Evaluation**: Metrics and methods to evaluate the effectiveness of the DRL agents in improving traffic conditions.

## Algorithms Used

### Primary Algorithm: Deep Q-Network (DQN)
The core of this project revolves around the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm. DQN is a model-free, off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that utilizes a deep neural network to approximate the Q-value function. This approach allows the agent to learn optimal policies in complex, high-dimensional state spaces, such as those found in traffic simulations.

### Comparative Analysis
For the purpose of comprehensive evaluation and to benchmark the performance of our DQN model, other prominent DRL algorithms were also implemented and tested along with baseline time controlled:
*   **Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C)**
*   **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**

These algorithms served as baselines for comparing the effectiveness and efficiency of the DQN approach in the context of traffic optimization.

## Getting Started

    cd ReinforcedTraffic
    ```
2.  (Add further installation steps, e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`)


## Results and Analysis

This section would typically include:
*   Performance metrics of the DQN agent (e.g., average waiting time, queue length, throughput).
*   Comparison of DQN's performance against A2C and PPO.
*   Visualizations, graphs, and tables summarizing the findings.
